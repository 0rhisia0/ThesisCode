Hello there, if you're wondering what this code is for, [here's the publication](https://purl.stanford.edu/jt073gr9153) that resulted from this!
These scripts and functions were used to build an Accelerated Bayesian Parameter Inference Framework for understanding and visualizing the 
capabilities of modern Liquid Xenon Time Projection Chambers. The code is free to use! Just please make sure you cite either this repository or 
the above publication. Have a great day!
